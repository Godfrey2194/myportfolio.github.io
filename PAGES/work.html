            <h3><strong>and design websites</strong> </h3>
            <p>I create and design very responsive and high quility websites.
                Using elements like typography,
                 illustration, photography and layouts, I always has an extremely
                  creative mind that can absorb visual trends and deploy them in fresh and exciting ways.

                <h4>Solor system Installation and aintainance</h4>
                <p>I help the locals install and maintain their solar systems. I do this by fixing the solor panels 
                    on the roofs in addition to wiring the house and installation ofthe circuts and other related necessary items.</p>
                <p><strong>NB:</strong> I do this out of my personal experience. I hope to go for a diploma in electrical
                engineering in the coming years.</p>

            <li>
                <h5>Relationship guidence and counselling</h5>
                <p>I also have experience in relationship counselling and guidence. With this experience, I have been 
                    able to help my friends and other people with relationship issues to get on their feet again.
                I 'facilitate' positive change from what is happening to them at any given time.
                I am there to help them communicate in a way in which they can learn to listen and talk to each other. 
                Many people shout or talk at each other and may have to learn to listen and talk to each other.

                <h6>Voluntary Ugandan Sign language training</h6>
                <p>Since I have a hearing imperment, I ventured into learning sign language with the aim of supplementing andd
                    making my communication easier.</p>
                <p>Now that am good at sign language, i decided to voluntarily train people who follow
                     in the same category as me and there parents as well as those who wigh to learn sign language. </p>
